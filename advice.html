                    <h2>Season's Affect on Allergies </h2>
                        <article>
                            <h3>Different seasons can affect different allergies. Here's how: </h3>
                            <p>Spring: Plants begin releasing pollen between Februrary and March. Tree pollen is often associated with this season.</p>
                            <p>Summer: In early summer, grass pollen is the most prominant. However, in later summer, ragweed and other weeds are prevelant. In July, mold is often at it's peak.</p>
                            <p>Fall: In October, Ragweed season often comes to an end, but the level of mold can become more severe.</p>
                            <p>Winter: Indoor allergens such as pet dander and dust mites may increase in severity due to the increased time spent indoors.</p>

                    <h2>The Weather's Affect on Us </h2>
                        <article>
                            <h3>How the weather affects us in different ways: </h3>
                            <p>Dry/ Windy Days: Hey fever can become more of an issue as the wind blows pollen into the air. It is advisory to keep your windows closed on windy days if you suffer from hay fever.</p>
                            <p>Moisure encourages the growth of mold. Dust mites also love humid air. However, if you have a pollen allergy, humid or damp days are good. This is because the moisture stops the pollen from blowing through the air, keeping the pollen on the ground.</p>
                            <p>Cold Air: People with asthma tend to find that cold air causes issues as cold air is able to trigger a coughing fit.</p>
                            <p>Heat: Air pollution worsens on hot days. Ozone and smog can result in a huge trigger for asthmatic people.</p>
